<p class="white-text">John was my older brother's friend. Being I am about six years younger than my brother, his friends were normally pretty dismissive of me. But John was one of the few of his friends who was always nice to me, always talked to me, and welcomed me to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D & D</a> table, once my bother deemed me old enough to play.</p>

  <p class="white-text">He was one of those people that you just don't forget. It had been over ten years since I had seen him when he died, but I still clearly remembered the laughs and fun times he created at the D & D table. D & D wasn't the same if John wasn't playing. He didn't just state his move, he acted it. And he always made you laugh.</p> 
   
  <p class="white-text">One of the things I heard after John died was that he was a founding member of a roleplaying theater in the Sacramento, California area. It seemed so perfect for him, and I imagine he shined at all the events where he performed.</p>
  
    <p class="white-text">My brother took John's death very hard. John passed on my brother's birthday, so it never stops being hard. I suppose that is one way to make sure your best friend doesn't forget you, but it wasn't necessary. No one would ever forget John. </p>

  <p class="white-text">A few days ago my brother was telling me about a dream he had. He was on a train and John was there. He asked John where his leather jacket was, and John responded that he was dead, and that my brother was wearing his leather jacket. And my brother was wearing the jacket. John was only on this planet for 36 years, he has been gone for 10 years, and he is still in our hearts and minds and dreams. And I dare say he will be in our hearts, minds, and dreams until we join him on the other side.</p>
